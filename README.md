# acados-quadrotor-nmpc

This project implements a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) for quadrotor trajectory tracking using the acados framework and PyBullet physics simulation. It achieves a mean tracking error of 3.0 mm and solve times under 1 ms.


# Requirements

The project is built with Python 3.9+ and requires the following software:

acados: High-performance solver for NMPC.

CasADi: For symbolic modeling and automatic differentiation.

PyBullet: Physics engine for the drone simulation.

Matplotlib & NumPy: For data visualization and numerical operations.
